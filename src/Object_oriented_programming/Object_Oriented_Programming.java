    //CLASS
    /*User defined data types used as a blueprint or template*/
    //OBJECT
    /*Instance of a class with defined data*/
    //METHOD
        /*Defines behaviour for an object, methods can
        be called on an object and modify it and other members*/
    //FIELD
    /*variables.Variables defined in the class that store data relevant or related to that class*/

    //SUPER AND SUB CLASSES
    /*Super and Sub classes can be used to transfer relevant data from one class to another
     * for example if you have a class human and a class kangaroo they can both be a super class of a class like
     * bipedal animals... if you than have a class dog and a class cat they can be super of non-bipedal
     * while bipedal and non-bipedal can than be supers of the animal class
     *
     * Sub classes go the other way around so while human is a super of bipedal and bipedal is a super of anima
     * the Sub class means it will go animal>bipedal>human instead of human>bipedal>animal*/


    //So for example we go to CLASS#DOGMAIN and CLASS#DOG inside the OBJECT_ORIENTED_PROGRAMMING package
